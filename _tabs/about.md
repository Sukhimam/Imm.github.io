I am a computer scientist with a strong passion for Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in the context of low-resource languages. My interests also extend to the fields of deep learning and machine learning, where I explore innovative ways to solve complex problems.

I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge in my areas of expertise and enjoy sharing insights through writing journal articles. By combining research and writing, I aim to contribute meaningful work that bridges technology and language, fostering inclusivity in the digital space.

Let's connect and collaborate to make impactful contributions to the field!
