**Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow**  
*Issued by Coursera, in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI*  
July 2020 

- Description: This course, part of the TensorFlow in Practice Specialization by DeepLearning.AI, focuses on implementing natural language processing (NLP) techniques using TensorFlow. It covers key topics such as tokenization, word embeddings, and sequence models like RNNs and LSTMs. Students learn to build, train, and deploy NLP models for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. The course emphasizes practical coding experience, with hands-on labs and projects using TensorFlow's advanced tools.

- Skills Covered: Word embeddings, sequence models, TensorFlow NLP APIs, text preprocessing.

**Natural Language Processing**  
*Issued by Coursera, in collaboration with Higher School of Economics, National Research University*  
Completed: April 2022  

- Description: This specialization, created by DeepLearning.AI and taught by Andrew Ng and his team, offers a comprehensive dive into NLP fundamentals and advanced techniques. It covers concepts like word embeddings, attention mechanisms, Transformers (e.g., BERT), and sequence-to-sequence models. Students learn to build models for tasks like machine translation, named entity recognition (NER), and question answering, focusing on real-world applications.

- Skills Covered: Attention, Transformers, sequence models, text generation, and NLP model evaluation.
